There are columns with names. There are two tables with customer purchasing behaviour. Data is cleaned using the Power BI editor.
LIFESTAGE: Customer attribute that identifies whether a customer has a family or not and what point in life they are at, e.g. are their children in pre-school/primary/secondary school.
PREMIUM_CUSTOMER: Customer segmentation is used to differentiate shoppers by the price point of products they buy and the types of products they buy. It is used to identify whether customers may spend more for quality or brand or whether they will purchase the cheapest options.
Pro analytics Tip: While the data set would not normally be considered large, some operations may still take some time to run. 
This is normal and to be expected when dealing with data sets at Quantium. Whilst your analysis is based on the whole data set, you may want to try some strategies to run sample solutions on a smaller subset of data I.e. create a sample solution using some of the data while it uploads.

What to find:
•	Purchasing habit multi-packet or single
•	understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

Requirements:
The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour. Consider what metrics would help describe the customers’ purchasing behaviour.

Customer Analysis 
A transaction data set with 264,837 columns and a customer behaviour data set with 72,638 columns were related to the Supermarket of a city, which has 272 stores. The data was from the fiscal year of 2017/2018. The task was to find the insight in sales, the best performing product among 114 different types of chips, the relation between different given customer segmentation and their purchasing habit.
This project involved analysing a hypothetical dataset with 264,837 rows and another dataset with 72,638 rows from a supermarket chain with 272 stores. The data covered the 2017/2018 fiscal year. The goal was to find insights into overall sales, identify the best-performing products among 114 types of chips, and understand the relationship between customer segments and their purchasing habits.
Key Responsibilities & Insights:
•	Prepared and cleaned datasets for analysis: standardised date formats, removed nulls, and joined transaction data.
•	Performed exploratory data analysis to evaluate sales volume, product quantity, and customer transaction patterns in Power BI visualisations (bar charts, pie charts, line charts). Analysed purchasing behaviour across segments, observing that Main Streams, Premium and Budget. Analysed purchasing behaviour across segments, observing that Main Streams, Premium and Budget.
