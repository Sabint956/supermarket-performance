There are columns with names. There are two tables with customer purchasing behaviour. Data is cleaned using Power BI editor.
LIFESTAGE: Customer attribute that identifies whether a customer has a family or not and what point in life they are at e.g. are their children in pre-school/primary/secondary school.
PREMIUM_CUSTOMER: Customer segmentation used to differentiate shoppers by the price point of products they buy and the types of products they buy. It is used to identify whether customers may spend more for quality or brand or whether they will purchase the cheapest options.
Pro analytics Tip: While the data set would not normally be considered large some operations may still take some time to run. 
This is normal and to be expected when dealing with data sets at Quantium. Whilst your analysis is based on the whole data set you may want to try some strategies to try running sample solutions on a smaller subset of data I.e. create a sample solution using some of the data while it uploads.

What to find:
•	Purchasing habit multi multi-packet or single
•	understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

Requirements:
The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour. Consider what metrics would help describe the customers’ purchasing behaviour.
