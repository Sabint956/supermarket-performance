LIFESTAGE: Customer attribute that identifies whether a customer has a family or not and what point in life they are at e.g. are their children in pre-school/primary/secondary school.
PREMIUM_CUSTOMER: Customer segmentation used to differentiate shoppers by the price point of products they buy and the types of products they buy. It is used to identify whether customers may spend more for quality or brand or whether they will purchase the cheapest options.
Pro analytics Tip: While the data set would not normally be considered large some operations may still take some time to run. 
This is normal and to be expected when dealing with data sets at Quantium. Whilst your analysis is based on the whole data set you may want to try some strategies to try running sample solutions on a smaller subset of data I.e. create a sample solution using some of the data while it uploads.

What to find:
•	Purchasing habit multi multi-packet or single
•	understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

Emil from the customer
Hi, 

Welcome again to the team, we love having new graduates join us! 

I just wanted to send a quick follow up from our conversation earlier with a few pointers around the key areas of this task to make sure we set you up for success. 

Below I have outlined your main tasks along with what we should be looking for in the data for each. 

Examine transaction data – look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. If you determine any anomalies make the necessary changes in the dataset and save it. Having clean data will help when it comes to your analysis. 

Examine customer data – check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and when you are happy merge the transaction and customer data together so it’s ready for the analysis ensuring you save your files along the way.

Data analysis and customer segments – in your analysis make sure you define the metrics – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find. These will all form part of our report to Julia. 

Deep dive into customer segments – define your recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis. 

Make sure you save your analysis in the CSV files and your visualisations – we will need them for our report. If you could work on this analysis and send me your initial findings by end of next week that would be great.  

Looking forward to reviewing your work. 

Thanks, 

Zilinka'

Requirements:

The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour. Consider what metrics would help describe the customers’ purchasing behaviour.
